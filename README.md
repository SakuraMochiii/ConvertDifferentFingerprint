# Multi-Module Fingerprint Recognition Demo using CloudPOS SDK AAR

## Overview
This demo showcases the capability of the CloudPOS SDK AAR in automatically recognizing various fingerprint modules. It focuses on obtaining an ISO fingerprint, converting it to ANSI format, and then comparing the ISO and ANSI fingerprints. This functionality is essential for versatile fingerprint recognition in smart POS systems.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Module Recognition
- **Detect Different Fingerprint Modules**: Automatically identifies and adapts to different fingerprint sensor modules.

### 2. ISO Fingerprint Acquisition
- **Get ISO Fingerprint**: Retrieves the ISO standard fingerprint from the sensor.

### 3. Conversion to ANSI
- **Convert to ANSI Format**: Transforms the ISO fingerprint data into ANSI format for broader compatibility.

### 4. Fingerprint Comparison
- **Compare ISO and ANSI Fingerprints**: Demonstrates the comparison between ISO and ANSI fingerprint formats to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Implementation
Follow the steps outlined in this guide to integrate the multi-module fingerprint recognition functionality in your smart POS application using the CloudPOS SDK AAR.
